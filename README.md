# autdatabase
The goal was to create a Centralized Contact Database for the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute which included the following deliverables: 
  A way to efficiently capture all contact information for people the Autism Institute interacts with - through the website, at events,       the patients/families that they interact with. 
  A way to refine the contact list when creating targeted communications. 
  A method for updating and maintaining a mailing list going forward.
